            <p>[12:44 PM, 8/7/2025] Rithika S: My most memorable day was during my previous job where I worked as an Accounts Executive. At that time, I had zero knowledge about income tax and TDS filing. Suddenly, I had to complete a TDS filing within two days, and no auditor could help. I stayed up all night, referred through the internet, and successfully completed the filing the next morning. My manager appreciated my effort, and I gained a lot of confidence. Another similar experience was when I handled a 15CA/CB form for international payment by myself and completed the task within 30 minutes. I even received a gift from my company for that. These moments proved that I can handle pressure and learn anything when determined."
[12:50 PM, 8/7/2025] Rithika S: "One of the most memorable days in my work life was when I had to file TDS for the first time. I had no idea about the process, and there was no auditor to guide me. But I didn’t want to give up, so I stayed up all night, searched online, and somehow completed it by the next morning. My manager appreciated me a lot for that. Another moment was when we had to process an international payment and needed Form 15CA and CB. Again, there was no auditor available, and the work was getting delayed. So I took the risk, learned it myself, and finished it within 30 minutes. My boss was so happy that they gifted me something. Those two moments gave me a lot of confidence and made me believe I can handle things under pressure."
